1: Description
--------------
Street Rod 3 (SR3) is a game made by a community consisting of developers, car enthusiasts, mechanics and fans of the original Street Rod games (SR1 & SR2).
The aim of the SR3 is to create a game with the gameplay of the first two Street Rod's but adding improved graphics, physics, sounds, and maybe even support for multiplayer modes.



2: Keys
--------------

Garage:

The main input device for the garage is the mouse. Left clicking is used to select items, click buttons, etc.
By holding down the right mouse button & dragging, you can rotate the camera around.
The arrow keys will also rotate the camera.

Pressing escape will get you out of dialogs, newspaper, and different screens. Press escape when in the default view (looking at the car only) and you'll be presented with the system menu to quit the game.

On bolts for the parts, left click will take the bolt off, right click will put the bolt back on.


Driving:

The arrow keys control the steering (left/right), acceleration (up) & braking (down).
A: Up gear
Z: Down gear
C: Change Camera
F: Flip the car onto the wheels (if the car rolled over or is stuck)
Escape: Go to system menu



3: Parameters
--------------

Add these parameters after the exe name to adjust settings:

-nosound	: Disables sound. Useful for people without sound cards
-window		: Windowed mode




4: Notes
--------------
This release is an ALPHA release. For those that don't know what that means, it basically is a development release. It is far from finished. The gameplay is unfinished, the graphics are temporary, and the code may have bugs in it.
The release is mainly for people to check out how sr3 is progressing, or for the dev team to check out the game and give the modellers/artists a base to try out cars & other stuff.
