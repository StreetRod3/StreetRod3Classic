Street Rod 3 ChangeLog 

v0.4.4.1
--Repaired a bug we had due to accidentally including the wrong exe and some data corruption

v0.4.4 
Features added in this version: 
--New cars have been included. 
--The 3D format has been changed to a non-encrypted variant of the AUX format used before. All meshes have been updated to accommodate the change. 
--Of course, the Street Rod 3 project is now Open-Source Software and is licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL). 
--Transmission code has been added so that users can modify gear ratios and number of gears. 
--The player now starts with $4900, as opposed to $1500. 
--New Versioning Scheme Bugs fixed in this version: 
--All in-game textures have been converted to PNG format to save both hard disk space and memory while the game is running. 
--AI always shifted at 4700 rpm, even after reaching third gear. This slowed it down. 
--AI now has a somewhat random, human-like reaction time. 
--Engine and car physics have been revamped. Among the many changes, wheelies are now possible. 
--Hacks removed to stop normally odd behavior. For example, now the red and green light work properly, controlling the status of the race.

Bugs that remain in this version: 
--Many wheels (especially those from the wheel pack) have a high polygon count. If you feel that the game is moving sluggishly, replace the wheels on your car with a wheel from the original game (i.e. normal tire, brand name tire, or racing slick). These are much easier on performance.
--In some cars, the AI car is not visible through the front windshield. 
--Reverse gear is entirely too fast. 
--Tachometer does not work in reverse gear. 
--Collision response is not enabled yet. Until then, you will be able to drive through your opponent. 
--It is still possible to flip your car, although rare. 
--It is still possible to run your car through the ground, although rare. 
--The number of forward gears is currently limited to nine, although any transmission with more than five will not be supported by the SR3 development team. 

Features planned in a future release: 
--The physics engine will be totally overhauled in favor of a more realistic system that relies on accurate torque and horsepower curves. --Differential ratios will be included in the same fashion as the transmission ratios are now.
